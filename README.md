# api-example-java

This sample simply retrieves the User record, creates a new integration, and then generates the URI used for authenticating that integration with the Work-API.

### Use 
- Enter your Work-API user token in `app/src/main/java/com/workapi/samples/java/App.java` in the `getClient` method. (If you don't already have a user token, see the Gudies for information on how to set up your environment and create a user account). 
- Run `./gradelw run`
